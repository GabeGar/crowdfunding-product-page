## My process

### Built with

-   Mobile-first workflow
-   [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
-   [Framer](https://www.framer.com/motion/) -ReactJS library
-   [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - CSS framework
-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   Flexbox

### What I learned

-   How to utilize and implement the framer-motion react library in my project, for handling animations and transitions.
-   Reinforced the concept of react's built-in global state management system, with createContext/useContext and useReducer hook, combination.

### Continued development

-   Improving the way I control complicated conditional statements, for triggering conditional renders. Definitely struggled a bit on this front as I was not able to get the modal design on the desktop overlay, 100%. Will likely come back to this at a later date.

### Useful resources

-   [Example resource 1](https://www.framer.com/motion/component/)
    -   for animating the components or built-in html elements.
